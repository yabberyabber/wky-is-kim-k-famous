# Why is Kim K famous?

Have you ever wondered why Kim K is famous?  Me too... I'm still not 100% sure why she's famous but doing this project has learned me a lot.  My belief is that it is the result of many small events, each of which brought her closer to public consciousness.  Once she was famous enough to have a TV show, the momentum propelled her to the top, but getting there involved a lot of things happening just right.

# How it was made

I skimmed through a couple dozen d3 tutorials and Perez Hilton articles. The data used to generate the graph is in js/dataset.js.  At the moment you need to write json by hand to add data... I don't have any immediate plans to change that.  

I have no artistic abilities.  I can tell it's ugly.  Contact me if you have stylistic advice. Pull requests welcome.
